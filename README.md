# SMTP_Email

Send emails to an emailing list automatically using a secure SMTP connection

Requires the following packages to be installed: <i>pandas</i><br>
The following packages should already be intalled with python but they are: <i>smtplib, ssl, getpass, email</i><br>

```
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install smtplib
pip3 install ssl
pip3 install getpass
pip3 install email
```

The `ssl_email_skeleton.py` skeleton is a decent layout if you want to plug in an Excel file and get to sending emails right away. Otherwise, check out the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/"><i>Pandas Documentation</i></a> on how to use CSV files and more.
